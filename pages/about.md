### Programming

I have experience programming in C#, JavaScript, Java, Python, and SQL. I also have experience with HTML and CSS building websites. In addition I have experience creating BI dashboards using the QlikView BI framework.

### Hobbies

One of my hobbies is building computers and researching computer components. I have built multiple PCs for myself and my friends and find it very enjoyable.

Another one of my hobbies is mountain biking. I really enjoy how it gets you out into nature and find that it a good outlet for getting a good workout and feeling very refreshed after.
